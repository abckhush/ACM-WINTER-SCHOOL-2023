    "# Chapter 1. End-to-End Machine Learning Project\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will work on an end-to-end machine learning project, pretending to be a recently hired data scientist at a real estate company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main steps we will go through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Framing the problem & looking at the big picture\n",
    "\n",
    "We Define the objective in business terms and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How would the solution be used?\n",
    "- What are the current solutions/workarounds?\n",
    "- How should we frame this problem? (`Supervised/Unsupervised`, `Batch/Online`, `Instance-based/Model-based`)\n",
    "- How should performance be measured?\n",
    "- Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?\n",
    "- What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?\n",
    "- What are comparable problems? can we use previous methods or tools?\n",
    "- Is human expertise available?\n",
    "- How would we solve the problem manually?\n",
    "- List the assumptions we/others have made so far?\n",
    "- Verify assumptions if possible\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Get the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is about data acquisition, we go through the following steps:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- We list the data we need and how much.\n",
    "- We find & Document where can we get that data.\n",
    "- We check how much space it will take.\n",
    "- We check the legal obligations & get authorization if necessary.\n",
    "- We get access authorization.\n",
    "- We create a workspace with enough storage space.\n",
    "- We get the data.\n",
    "- We convert the data into a format we can easily manipulate.\n",
    "- We ensure sensitive information is either deleted or protected.\n",
    "- We check the size & type of data.\n",
    "- We sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explore the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "After acquiring the necessary data, we explore its properties by doing the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- We create a copy of the data for exploration and sample it down if necessary\n",
    "- We create a Jupyter notebook to save our data exploration sessions.\n",
    "- We study each attribute (column) and its characteristics:\n",
    "    - Name\n",
    "    - Type (Categorical, Continuous, Int/Float, Structured/Unstructured, Text ..)\n",
    "    - % of missing values\n",
    "    - Noisiness and type of noise (Stochastic, rounding error, ..)\n",
    "    - Usefulness for the task\n",
    "    - Type of distribution (Gaussian, Logarithmic, Uniform ..)\n",
    "- For supervised Learning tasks, we identify the target attribute\n",
    "- We visualize the data\n",
    "- We study the correlations between attributes\n",
    "- We study how we would solve the problem manually\n",
    "- We identify the promising transformations we may want to apply\n",
    "- We Identify Extra data that would be useful\n",
    "- We Document what we have learned in report\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now's the time to prepare the data for machine learning. We go through the following list:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We create a copy of the data.\n",
    "- We write functions for all the data transformations we want to apply: we do this once for reproducibility on test and production data. Packaging functions like this will also allow us to treat preprocessing steps as hyper-parameters.\n",
    "- We clean the data by fixing or removing outliers, and filling missing values with `0`, mean, median, inference, .. or drop their rows/columns.\n",
    "- We conduct feature selection: we drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task\n",
    "- We conduct feature engineering. Examples of feature engineering:\n",
    "    - Discretize continuous features\n",
    "    - Decompose features (Categorical, datetime, ...)\n",
    "    - Add promissing feature transformations ($log(x)$, $sqrt(x)$, $x^{2}$, ..)\n",
    "    - Aggregate features into promising new features\n",
    "- We scale the features of interest by standarizing and/or normalize them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Shortlist promising models\n",
    "\n",
    "After preparing the data, we select and shortlist potential models that may solve the problem:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the data set is big, we sample smaller datasets for experimentation.\n",
    "- We try many models from different categories (`NB`, `Linear regression`, `RF`, `NN`, ..) using standard parameters.\n",
    "- We measure and compare their performances: for each model, we measure `N`-fold cross validation and capture the mean and standard diviation of the performance.\n",
    "- We analyze the most significant variable for each algorithm.\n",
    "- We analyze the types of errors the models make. What data would we use to avoid these errors?\n",
    "- We perform a quick round of feature selection and engineering.\n",
    "- We perform one or two more quick iterations of the previous steps.\n",
    "- We shortlist the top-`3`-to-`5` most performant algorithms that make different types of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Fine-tune your models & combine them into a great solution\n",
    "\n",
    "After shortlisting the most promising algorithms, it's time to fine-tune their performance, ensemble them and export a final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We should use the whole dataset\n",
    "- We fine-tune hyper-parameters using cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "We treat our data transformation choices as hyper-parameters. Unless there are very few hyper-parameters to explore, we should prefer random search to grid search. If training takes a long time, we try out Bayesian Optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We try ensemble methods. Combining the best models will often produce better results than running them individually.\n",
    "- Once we are confident about the model, we measure its performance on the test set to estimate its generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Present the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "After exporting a final model, it's time to present the work in an accessible fashion:\n",
    "- We document what we have done\n",
    "- We create a nice presentation\n",
    "- We explain why our solution achieves the business objective\n",
    "- We showcase interesting things we noticed along the way\n",
    "- We ensure the key findings are easily communicated through beautiful visualization and one-line statements\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Launch, Monitor, and maintain your system\n",
    "\n",
    "After presenting our findings, it's time to launch, monitor, and maintain the system:\n",
    "- We get our solution ready for production\n",
    "- We write monitoring code to check our system's performance while running in production and run interval-based checks to alert when it drops.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this step, we should be aware of the \"slow degradation\" phenomena: models tend to rot as data evolves. We should also monitor ourr inputs quality. Finally, we re-train the model on a regular basis on fresh data"

    "## 1. Look at the big picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task is to use the california census data to build a model of the housing prices in the state. This data includes features such as:\n",
    "- Population\n",
    "- Median Income\n",
    "- Median housing price for each block group in California\n",
    "\n",
    "A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which cencus data is published. A Block group has a population between 600 to 3,000. We will call them \"districts\" for short.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Our model should be able to predict the median housing price for any district, given the other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frame the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question we should ask is: \"What is the business objective?\". Building a model is probably not the end goal for us. This leads us to the more important question: \"How does the comapny expects to benefit from the model?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Our boss answers that the model's output (A prediction for a district's median housing price) will be fed along other signals to another model to decide whether or not to invest in the district. Getting this information right is critical, as it's directly connects to revenue. In our case, our prediction will serve as input to another model that attempts to increase the company's return on investment (ROI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are talking about our data flowing from model to model, it might be of benefit for us to define a \"data pipeline\". A sequence of data processing components is called a **data pipeline** Pipelines are very common is machine learning systems, since data needs to be preprocessed, manipulated, transformed to output the final predictions. The pipeline's components typically run asynchonosly. Each component pulls in a large amount of data, process it and spits out a result (prediction) into a data store. Each component is fairly self-contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a company, different teams can focus on different components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next question to ask your boss is \"what the current solution looks like?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is a supervised learning problem, and because we're predicting the median housing price for a district (which is numerical), then this is a **Regression Task**. We can also categorize this problem as a batch learning problem since cencus data is historical and does come every year.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If the data is huge, we can either split the data between multiple servers using Map Reduce or use online learning."

    "### Select a Performance Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical performance measure for regression problems is **Root Mean Squared Error**. It has a higher weight for large errors. Its general formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ RMSE(X,h) = \\sqrt{ {1 \\over m} \\sum_{i=1}^m ( h(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} )^2  }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Wehre $m$ is the number of instances in the dataset you are measuring the $RMSE$ on, $x^{(i)}$ is a vector containing all of the input feature values (excluding the label) for the $i^{th}$ instance. $y^{(i)}$ is the label or the desired output of input $x^{(i)}$, and $X$ is a matrix containing all feature values excluding the labels/targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $i^{th}$ row of $X$ corresponds to $x^{(i)}$ and we can note:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X=\\left(\n",
    "\\begin{array}{c}\n",
    "  {x^{(1)}}^{T}\\\\\n",
    "  {x^{(2)}}^{T}\\\\\n",
    "  {x^{(3)}}^{T}\\\\\n",
    "  \\vdots\\\\\n",
    "  {x^{(m)}}^{T}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$h(.)$ is the system's prediction function, also called hypothesis. $RMSE(X,h)$ is the cost function measured on the set of examples $X$ and the hypothesis $h$. $RMSE$ is the preferred performance measure for regression tasks, but sometimes, we prefer to use other cost functions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $MAE$: We use mean absolute error in the case where we have many outliers (also called the average absolute diviation):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MAE(X,h) = {1 \\over m} \\sum_{i=1}^m |h(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both $RMSE$ and $MAE$ are ways to measure the distance between two vectors. In our case, the distance between the vector of predictions and the vector of targets/labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, various distance measures, or norms, are possible. Computing the root of the sum of squares ($RMSE$) corresponds to the euclidian norm (also called $l_{2}$ norm). Computing the sum of absolutes ($MAE$) corresponds to the $l_{1}$ norm. More generally, the norm $l_{k}$ of a vector $\\bf{x}$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$||v||_{k} = (\\sum_{i=1}^{m} |v_{i}|^{k})^{1 \\over k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With $l_{0}$ giving the number of non-zero elements in the vector $v$, and $l_{\\infty}$ giving the maximum absolute value in the vector $v$. The higher the norm index, the more it focuses on large values and neglects small ones. This is why $RMSE$ is more sensitive to large errors than $MAE$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When outliers are exponentially rare (like in a bell curve) $RMSE$ performs extremely well and is preferred over other cost functions."

Our machine learning algorithms may learn that prices never go beyond that limit. In reality, we need to check with our client's team if this can be a problem or not. If they tell us that they need precise predictions even beyond 500,000 USD, then we have 2 options:\n",

    "There are two ways to get all features to have the same scale:\n",

    "Standardization produce values with a mean of `0` and a standard deviation of `1`. Unlike Min-Max scaling, standardization doesn't bound values to a specific range. This can cause problems for some ML algorithms (Example: NNs usually expect inputs range from 0 to 1). However, standarization is much less effected by outliers.\n",

One way to do this is to save the whole pre-processing pipeline, the predictor (using joblib) then load it into the production environment and use `.predict()` to output new predictions.
